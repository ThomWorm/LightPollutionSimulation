The workflow for my work with FUTURES in GRASS was copied largely from the GRASS FUTURES tutorial availible here:
https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FUTURES_tutorial

Unfortunately, I did most of this work early in the semester and I neglected to save a list of the specific GRASS commands I used. Future re-workings of this project will 
include full documentation of my GRASS commands. All data for this project came from freely-availible federal sources, and can be provided on request.


The Google Earth Engine component of my analysis is availble here:
